## User Experience (UX)

-   ### User stories

    -   #### First Time Visitor Goals

        1. As a First Time Visitor, I want to easily understand the main purpose of the site and learn more about the individual.
        2. As a First Time Visitor, I want to be able to easily navigate throughout the site to find content.
        3. As a First Time Visitor, I want to look through their portfolio to understand what their skillset and personality is and if they are competent. I also want to locate their social media links to see their content on social media to determine how trusted and known they are.

    -   #### Returning Visitor Goals

        1. As a Returning Visitor, I want to find information about upcoming and/or developed projects.
        2. As a Returning Visitor, I want to find the best way to get in contact with the individual with any questions I may have.
        3. As a Returning Visitor, I want to find their social links.

    -   ### Design
    -   #### Colour Scheme
        -   The three main colours used are teal, grey and black.
    -   #### Typography
        -   I opted to use the default Bootstrap font Apple System, due to it’s clean font style, which fitted in with the aesthetic I wanted for the website.
    -   #### Imagery
        -   A strong profile image was used on the home page, to catch the user’s attention. Strong imagery has been proven to help engage the user.

### Testing User Stories from User Experience (UX) Section

-   #### First Time Visitor Goals

    1. As a First Time Visitor, I want to easily understand the main purpose of the site and learn more about the individual. 

        1. Upon entering the site, users are automatically greeted with a clean and easily readable navigation bar to go to the page of their choice. Underneath there is a profile image with a small blurb and a Download CV and Contact, call to action buttons.
        2. The user has two options, click the call to action buttons or scroll down, both of which will lead to the same place, to learn more about the individual.

    2. As a First Time Visitor, I want to be able to easily be able to navigate throughout the site to find content.

        1. The site has been designed to be fluid and never to entrap the user. At the top of each page there is a clean navigation bar, each link describes the page they will end up at clearly.
        2. At the bottom of the first 3 pages there is a redirection call to action to ensure the user always has somewhere to go and doesn't feel trapped as they get to the bottom of the page.

    3. As a First Time Visitor, I want to look through their portfolio to understand what their skillset and personality is and if they are competent. I also want to locate their social media links to see their content on social media to determine how trusted and known they are. 

	    1. Once the new visitor has read the about me and resume, they will notice the contact section.
        2. The user can also scroll to the bottom of any page on the site to locate social media links in the footer.
        3. At the bottom of the contact page, the user is told underneath the form, that alternatively they can contact the individual on social media which highlights the links to them.

### Further Testing

-   The Website was tested on Google Chrome and Safari browsers.
-   The website was viewed on a variety of devices such as Desktop, Laptop, iPhone 5SE & Samsung Galaxy S10.
-   A large amount of testing was done to ensure that all pages were linking correctly.
-   Friends and family members were asked to review the site and documentation to point out any bugs and/or user experience issues.

### Known Bugs

-   On some mobile devices some of the Resume sub headings are slightly out of center alignment.
-   Some spacing of elememts is noticable due to the responsive nature of the website and the sticky navbar.

## Deployment
This site is hosted using GitHub pages, deployed directly from the master branch. The deployed site will update automatically upon new commits to the master branch. In order for the site to deploy correctly on GitHub pages, the landing page must be named `index.html`.
